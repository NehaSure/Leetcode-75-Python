#Two Sum
#Brute force gives the complexity of O(n*2)
by using hashmap we can achieve the complexity of O(n)

Code

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self,num, target):
        hashmap = {}
        for i in range(len(num)):
            diff = target - num[i]
            if diff in hashmap:
                return [hashmap[diff], i]
            hashmap[num[i]] = i

# Calling function 
solution = Solution()
output = solution.twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9)
print(output)  # Expected Output: [0, 1]
